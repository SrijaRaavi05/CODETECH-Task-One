ID: CT08DS3102.

Domain: VLSI.

Duration: June to July 2024. 


Overview of the Project 

Project: Digital Logic Design with Verilog.

Objective:
	Designed basic digital logic circuits like logic gates, adders and multiplexers using Verilog within VLSI software.
 
Key Activities:
	Logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR, NOT), Adders (half adder and full adder) and Multiplexers (2:1MUX, 4:1MUX, 8:1MUX, 16:1MUX) are designed and simulated with the use of testbench by giving all possible input values.
 
Technology Used: Xilinx vivado 2024.1 software.
